## How to Make Changes to the PHRED Website

# Download Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code (more commonly, VSCode) is a free code editor. It is an industry standard with support for many different coding languages and tools.

  Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
  Click on the large button under your OS (for example, if you are on Windows, click on the button indicated in red by the image below).


# Install Visual Studio Code
Your download should appear in the top right corner of your web browser

  Double-click on the download for VSCodeUserSetup to start the installation.
  Click the option to Accept if you agree to the Microsoft software license terms.
  Continue with the installation accepting the default options and then click Install.
  Once installed, you can run VSCode by searching for the app on your computer or running it from the desktop.



# Get PHRED Website code from GitHub
GitHub is a website where people can work together on projects, especially for writing code or creating software. More technically, it‚Äôs version control software for managing code and code changes. 

  To see the PHRED website code, go to https://github.com/PHREDRobotics/phred-website
  In GitHub terms, the PHRED website code is stored in its own repository.
  The Home page of the website is created with the file, index.html.
  Other website pages for PHRED are listed as well (for example, about.html and contact.html)
  Feel free to double-click on the files or folders within the PHRED website in GitHub to explore the code.
  To download the PHRED website code, return to VSCode
  On the top menu, select View, then select Terminal. 
  In the Terminal window, confirm that your current directory is your User directory
  If on windows, you will see something like this: 
  C:\Users\your-user-directory> 
  If you don‚Äôt, you can get to this directory by type the following two commands into the terminal and press ENTER after each:
  cd C:\Users\
  dir
  Your user directory should be listed under name. When you find it, type cd followed by the name into the terminal and press ENTER:
   cd your-user-directory
  Now that you are in your user directory, type the following in the Terminal window and press ENTER.
  git clone https://github.com/PHREDRobotics/phred-website.git

		When it is done, you‚Äôll have the PHRED website code on your own computer.
  Open the PHRED website code Visual Studio Code

  Select the phred-website folder and click Select Folder
  If successful, you will see the same files that were on GitHub. Feel free to explore the files. This is a copy of the code from GitHub and nothing you change here will affect the official PHRED website (at least not yet! üòâ)
