Motto? Futures under construction

    PHRED Robotics
    Futures under construction
    Add logos for all teams (FRC, FTC, FLL)
    Focus on more than PHS robotics... 4th thru 12th
    De-emphasize Philomath High
    Highlight smallness of our team/district with flashy stats
    Highlight top sponsors on front page

Carry the theme "under Construction" onto other pages... sponsors under construction
